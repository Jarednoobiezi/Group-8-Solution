          <p class="td2p2">
            Gender issues were prevalent during historical times—imperial and ancient times. Especially during Ancient Chinese where gender issues are mostly
            experienced by women. Women at that time had no legal rights to property, which nowadays can be solved by providing a law to give
            women a right to tangible properties just like what men have (1). Moreover, Chinese women during ancient times were also restricted to work, they are
            not entitled to do what men do, as well as to get an opportunity to avail what men do (2). Since these women were restricted to work, they were
            limited in weaving and other household jobs as their primary role as a woman, as an intervention tothat, laws that have a provision on equity and
            equality on job and career opportunity (3). Overpowering men is belittling women, as stated in the 4th and 5th whys, giving men a lot of
            opportunities and accessibility is indirectly proportional to what women receives, gender empowerment and government support programs are useful in
            order to establish firm understanding regarding social and gender biases and divisions (4-5).

            Chosen solution with media bases
          </p>
          <p class="td2p2">
            All of the problems and issues being encountered by Chinese women were all because of downgrading and invalidating women’s ability and character.
            This will be solved through gender empowerment and proper government support. Giving them a voice to speak will give them an opportunity to gain
            power and acquire and experience what men do. Career and jobs will be equally given by proper gender empowerment and promoting a good division of
            genders roles. According to T. Manahan (2017), opening and giving enough awareness to young minds will enable the society to lessen gender
            discrimination and inequality. Also, M. Balingasa (2020), educating the society and its people will allow all gender preferences to access all the
            opportunities and be treated equally. This only means that establishing good education and awareness would also establish firm and equal gender
            treatment.

            The First thing I Noticed about Ancient China. They Treat Girls or Women as a Puppet.
            They  use women to give them an heir to the throne or for their money so that the legacy of the father will be passed to the son. They also mistreat
            their wives or concubines because there are concubines that don’t wanna Sleep with the Emperor because they don't want to conceive a baby, It's
            Considered Disloyalty and Not fulfilling your Duty as the Emperor’s Concubine . This is happening because of lack of power in Family Affairs and
            because of their Parents Greediness. Even though women try to Protect themselves from the Cruelness of their Husbands, they will only end up doing
            the same thing to avoid getting beaten or punished, They have no Choice to do what her Husband says. Their are also women who has Power at Ancient
            China like the Empress Dowager and the Empress they became the Voice of Women who Experienced Abuse from their Husband and Discrimination from Peopl
            . What is the Duty or Responsibility of an Empress in Ancient China, An Empress was Honored as the “Mother of the State” and Served as a Role Model
            Women Throughout the Empire, An Empress didn’t have any Decisional Power Regarding the State Affairs, but was the Head of the Inner Palace. Giving
            birth to sons was the Primary Duty of an Imperial Consort, and she was Expected to Properly Raise and help Educate her Young Boys. Every son born to
            an Empress or any other Imperial Consort had an Equal Chance to Reign over the Empire.

            Solution and Media
          </p>
          <p class="td2p2">
            The reason why women can’t show their Ability to Lead the State is because of lack of State Affairs, and because of People’s judgment and opinion,
            such as women should stay at home doing household chores and taking care of their children. In Ancient China many People believe in Rumors that is
            why there are women who are being abandoned by their family or husband because they don’t want to be embarrassed especially if they’re a high
            ranking official in the state.  But now Government has put on a law about Gender Inequality such as The Gender Equality law 2011, seeks to Eliminate
            Discrimination in Employment, Training and Recruitment on the Basis of Sex, Marital Status, Pregnancy or gender and to Promote the Payment of Equal
            Remuneration  to Male and Female Employees, Also Actress Emma Watson gave a Speech about Gender Equality, Emma Watson Created a Compassionate Tone
            in Order to Convey Men, Specifically those who Negatively Perceived Feminism or did not think that Feminism issues affected them. This is one of her
            Speech “ No Country in the World can yet say they have Achieved Gender Equality”, Every women Deserves Respect  and Equal Treatment, now that we
            have a law about Gender Equality we can Easily Protect ourselves with Discrimination and Homophobic People in this World. For the Young Minds out
            there try to Develop a Healthy Community with People and your Surroundings not only to Avoid Issue or Arguments but also to have a Healthy and safe
            Lifestyle.

            Gender Issues during Ancient China are mostly experienced by women. Women in Ancient
            China did not enjoy status and they were restricted in participating in various realms of social life, through social stipulations that they
            remained indoors, whilst outside business were conducted by men.
          </p>
          <p class="td2p2">
            Women during Ancient China didn’t have legal rights to property, this can be only solved by
            providing women rights to substantial property. Women during Ancient China were restricted to do work, because of this they practiced foot-binding
            which made them unable to stand and walk. Since most women were restricted to work, they were only limited in weaving silk.

         <p class="td2p2">
          Women in ancient China did not enjoy the status, either social or political, afforded to men. Women were subordinate to first their fathers, then
          their husbands, and finally, in the case of being left a widow, their sons in a system known as the “three followings” or sancong. Often physically
          ill-treated, socially segregated, and forced to compete for their husband's affections with concubines, a woman's place was an unenviable one.
         </p>
         <p class="td2p2">
           Still, despite the harsh realities of living in a male-dominated society and being forever under the weight of philosophical and religious norms
           which were created by men to work for men, some women did break through these barriers. The practical realities of daily life meant many women could
           and did circumvent conventions, and some rose to live extraordinary lives producing great literature, scholarship, and even ruling the Chinese empire
           itself.
